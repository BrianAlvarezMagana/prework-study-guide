## Description

Study guide for pre-work
I wanted to create a centralized location to save and organize my notes on what I have learned in this bootcamp.
I built this program to organize my notes in case I ever need to recall what I have learned
It also allows me to not lose my notes and gives me an easy way to access them
I learned how to use HTML, CSS, GitHub, and JavaScript

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
